QPi is an implementation of the Qiskit platform meant to facilitate learning by visualising the Bloch Sphere from different views.

To build a QPi you will need:

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Power Supply for the Raspberry Pi
- Micro SD card with at least 8GB of storage
- 5 inch screen (or bigger) [Like This one](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/4000285089550.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.532063c0x1I59N)
- Ready to use holo pyramid (or you can build your own)
- [Optional] Raspberry Pi Battery Hat 
- [Optional] 3D printer 
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Visualise Bloch Sphere in 3 dimention (with 4 views)
- Wifi Access point to allow you to use it in uknown territory (without internet connection)

## Get Started 
You can get QPi in 2 different way

- Download the ready to use image and write it in the SD 
- Follow the Tutorial to install it yourself
